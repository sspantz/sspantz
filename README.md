### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Frontend Developer who loves maths from CHINA.

My research/study interests include Cryptology, Algorithms, Software Engineering and Functional Programming.

JavaScript and C are my favorite programming lauguages, and I use them all the time. I think RUST will be the next.
