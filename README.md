### Hi there 👋


I'm a Frontend Developer who loves maths from CHINA.

My research/study interests include Cryptology, Algorithms, Software Engineering and Functional Programming.

JavaScript and C are my favorite programming lauguages, and I use them all the time. I think RUST will be the next.

English is preferred(for study purpose), although I'm not a native English speaker and my English level is relatively low.

Last but no least, it's perfect to concat me in Cantonese and Mandrain.
